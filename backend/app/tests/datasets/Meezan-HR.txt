of Paper’ and ‘Punctuality’ will be marked by HR. L&D. The rating is based on the number of papers cleared ea ch 
year and the leaves availed by the trainee during the assessment period. Since our objective is to encourage the Trainee 
towards completion of ACCA qualification along with exceptional performance on job with punctuality, therefore, 
the rating will be m arked by HR, L&D as per the below structure:

Page 27 of 141 
 
 
 
 
Based on the overall rating achieved by trainee and fulfilling criteria, i ncrement on renewal will be made as per the 
defined structure:  
 
 
 
NB: 
- No increment on renewal will be given for trainees who have not attempted any paper during the period.  
- No increase will be made after 3 years of contract (if exceeds)

or breach of any provisions of the contract; or fails to show progress satisfactorily as per the defined performance 
criteria. The decision of the Bank in this regard will be final.  
 
During the first three (3) months from the signing of the initial contract, the Trainees w ould be observing a probation 
period during which service can be terminated by either side by giving seven (7) days’ notice.  
If the Trainee decides to terminate the contract after probationary period, the Trainee has to serve a notice period of

Employee compensation may be the single most vital aspect of business. Compensation is the payment a business gives to its 
employees in exchange for their services.  
While the most common forms of cash compensation is monthly salary, compensation also may include commissions, 
performance linked incentives, bonuses based on the performance of the business, equity in the business in the form of stock 
options, and/or fringe ben efits. In addition to cash compensation, businesses often provide their employees with group benefits 
such as group insurance (medical, dental, term life, etc.), the availability of flexible healthcare spending accounts, disabi lity 
insurance, retirement be nefits, sick days, vacation time, and/or other benefits.  
Businesses succeed or fail based on the quality of employees work, and compensation generally is considered the most 
important factor in attracting and retaining quality employees.  
 
Branches will ensure that all salary amendments (Joining, transfers, salary account numbers, salary stoppage request etc.) must 
reach the Human Resource Departmen t latest by 15th of every month via e -mail. Staff monthly salary will be disburs ed before 
the end of that month.  
 
 
Employees in need of funds for an emergency may be allowed advance against salary for the particular month to be adjusted 
in full at the time of monthly payroll. Since this facility is only meant for emergencies, no staff member is allowed to avail this 
facility more than two times a year.  
 
An employee wishing to avail this facility should make a request through HRMS for salary advance duly recommended by the 
Line Manager/ Department Head. In case of emergency, the employee could use email facility to infor m his/her Line Manager/ 
Department Head but will have to later incorporate that request in HRMS.  
 
The request is approved by the Head of Human Resource and forwarded to the Finance Department for disbursement.  
 
Sub-Payroll (for some specific employees) is executed on 5th, 10th and 15th of each month for advances against salaries. In case 
the date falls on a holiday, the sub -payroll execution is forwarded to the next working day.  
 
 
Employees are personally responsib le for preparation and submission of their personal income tax, any other personal taxation 
returns / reports for the payment of taxes and of other statutory dues. The Bank undertakes no responsibility or liability in  this 
respect, except for deduction of taxes at source, depositing the same with the concerned authorities, submitting required 
statements to the income tax department and providing a salary and tax certificate for the tax year to concerned employees.  
 
 
The pay scale has been developed incorporating feedback from a banking industry salary survey. The bank will follow its pay 
scales in vogue at the time when offering salaries. The pay scale is a confidential document and Head of HR is custodian of t he 
same.  
 
The pay scale may be  amended based on recommendation of HR and approval of the HR Committee.

Succession planning is the practice of recognizing  and developing employees with the potential to fill leadership positions.  
 
Succession planning is a continuous and dynamic process  that recognizes that some jobs are significant for the performance 
of the organization, too important to be left vacant, which must be occupied by the most suitably qualified employees.  
 
The following Guideline & Procedure are to be read in conjunction with th e policy on the same.  
 
 
• Identify key jobs for the succession planning process  
• Define the competencies ( knowledge, skills, soft -skills ) profile required to undertake those roles  
• Assess people against these criteria  
• Make judgments on potential for future performance and thus identify individuals who could potentially deliver in 
key jobs.  
• Develop these employees to be ready for advancement into key roles – primarily through the right set of experiences.  
 
The f ollowing steps are required for the succession planning process of Meezan Bank:  
 
1. STRATEGIC AND WORKFORCE PLANNING DECISIONS  
• Relating the Vision and Mission of the organization to its structure and organogram  
• Positioning the organization at a competitive po sition of the job market  
• Identifying key functions / positions ( Focus on Important and Hard -to-Fill Jobs ) 
• Documenting the desired competency profiles – knowledge, skills, attitudes, experience --  for key positions  
 
2. IDENTIFY POOL OF POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS  
• Assessing competency and skill levels of current incumbents and other executives  
• Identifying successor staff with relevant competences  from various disc iplines  
• Review their actual performance on current and previous jobs  
• Assess the potential of the employee for performing at higher levels  
• Analyzing possible external sources of needed talent.  
 
3. ANALYZE GAPS  
• Comparing the desired profiles of positions vis -à-vis  profiles of available candidates for the positions  
• Identifying deficit of skills / soft skills /  experience in candidates  
• Identifying possible continuity issues  
 
4. COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POOL OF SUCCESSORS  
• Identifying developmen t & learning opportunities for candidates, including planned job assignments, coaching, 
mentoring, training programs, etc.  
• Identifying possible retention issues for candidates being groomed for higher positions.  
• Implementing competence development for thes e employees  
 
5. IMPLEMENT SUCCESSION PLAN, MONITOR , EVALUATE , RE-VISIT  
This step completes the iteration and involves:  
• Tracking selections from pool of successors  
• Taking feedback on success of internal talent in higher jobs  
• Responding to changing requirem ents and needs.

The Objective is t o offer and encourage job rotational opportunities for current employees, who have the desire to enhance 
their skills and develop new competencies to pursue different or greater responsibilities.  
 
Periodic rotation of staff between various assignments is used by Meezan Bank Ltd. as a means of broadening areas of expertise 
of concerned staff. This is a lso done to ensure smooth transition from one job to another incase a staff member leaves or is 
transferred to another job or location.  
 
Whenever practically possible, the Staff members posted at branches will be rotated periodically. The basic guideline for 
rotation is as follows.  
 
a) All staff members of Meezan Bank’s branches should be rotated from their specific assignments after completing a 
certain period of service as elaborated below within the same region.  
 
b) This rotation may mean transfer from one po sition to another within same department in branch, transfer from one 
department to another in branch or from one branch to another branch.  
 
c) An appropriate time frame for job rotation may be : - 
 
a. Branch Staff    Three years  
b. Branch Managers    Four years  
When an employee completes above mentioned time period on the same job or in the same branch, he/she should be 
transferred to any other position and/or branch.  
 
The Line Manager(s) would initiate transfer request in consultation with the functional departm ent and/or Human Resource 
Department.  
 
The approval hierarchy in such cases would be the same as of the normal transfer.  
 
Human Resource Department will send a quarterly intimation/ email to regional managers with copy to relevant functional 
heads regardin g the rotation of branch staff who have  completed the criterion mentioned in the policy.

Meezan Bank Ltd. believes in promoting open, direct and honest communication among all units and individuals of the Bank. 
Towards this end, a number of tools / mediums could be used as mentioned  below. Efforts will continue to open up new 
channels of communication as and when feasi ble. All employees are encouraged to make use of these tools/mediums and 
channels to keep themselves informed of what is going on in the Bank, as well as to enhance their professional skills and 
knowledge, aimed at furthering their careers.  
 
Branches and departments should assist and encourage Bank’s employees in using internal communication facilities. Overall 
performance of branches / departments is greatly enhanced by promoting a culture of caring, sharing and opening channels of 
internal c ommunication.  
 
 
All branches will install a notice board in a prominent area frequently used by employees. The Manager Operations of every 
branch must ensure an orderly and timely use of this board for displaying latest circulars (in ternal or external), important news 
items, information related to upcoming training courses or meetings and events of common interest.  
 
 
All branches / departments may have a monthly meeting of all their employ ees. A certain day  of each month may be fixed for 
such meetings. A written record of proceedings of these meetings may be maintained by the Branch/ Department. The 
concerned Regional Manager or Department Head may also attend some of these meetings without  prior notice.  
 
 
Use of telephone for communicating with outstation units / employees should be restricted. E -mail should be used instead. 
Employees that have been provided e -mail facilities at the office must  check their mail at least twice every day  and ensure timely 
archiving of emails to prevent the “Data disk quota exceeded” issue , otherwise they will be held responsible for delays caused 
by their ignorance of their mail. It is the Bank’s endeavor to make e-mail available to all employees of the Bank, so that the 
bulk of all internal communication should be routed via e -mail. Only in cases where documentary record for legal purposes 
needs to be created or for communication of a sensitive nature, should fax and courier be used.  
 
 
The Learning  & Development Department of the bank will issue periodical newsletters for employees to remain update d with 
the Bank, employees and other stakeholders’ activities. The newsletter will be av ailable on intranet of the bank for easy access. 
Moreover the intranet platform will also be used for the placement of p olicies / procedure documents , notices and any other 
official material of common interest .

Transfers of staff stationed at Head Office & Regional Office with VP & above grade will be approved by CEO.  
 
All the approved TRFs should be sent to HRD for issuance of Transfer Order. Under no circumstances will a transfer be 
effective without a Transfer Order.  
 
 
The employees are usually considered at the time of posting for a reasonably appropriate Branch that facilitates commuting 
employee ’s residence. However, every employee is supposed to perform duty wherever and whenever he/she is posted.  
 
A transfer at own request may only be considered subject to legitimacy of request, availability of vacant slot in the destination 
branch, backup replacement in the source branch, approval of the management etc. A transfer at own request cannot be taken 
as a matter of right under any circumstances. An employee permanently transferred to a nother location at own request will not 
be entitled to any facility.  
 
 
As far as possible, attempt will be made to select candidates belonging to the geographical area where they need to be posted , 
in order to minimize the need for relocation. However, in terms of the Bank’s service contract/ appointment terms, services 
of an employee are transferable to any location within the country as per requirements of the Bank.  
 
The transfer of an employee that is for mor e than 30 days but less than 90 days with a future plan for further 
relocation/reposting is a “Temporary Transfer”.  
 
The transfer of an employee that is for more than 90 days without any future plan for further relocation/reposting is a 
“Permanent Transfer ”. 
 
 
The transfer of an employee from one city to another is Inter City Transfer. The intercity transfers are meant for employees at 
or above the following grades / positions.  
 
a) Manager Operations and Branch Manager  
b) Any other employee at the grade of AVP I & above  
 
In case of a genuine need for salary adjustment of the employee, the concerned Regional Manager may recommend a salary 
adjustment provided that incumbent ’s job profile is being enhanced. However, this adjustme nt will be approved by Head of 
Branch Banking, DCEO  and President & CEO. Any resource below the above levels will be recruited locally and shall not be 
transferred from one city to another in normal circumstances.  
 
1) Intercity Temporary Transfer : 
Employees traveling on temporary transfers from one city to another will be eligible to avail the following facilities:  
 
a) Tickets  
The employee will be entitled for air ticket (or Railway or Bus/Coach tickets, as applicable) for self -only.  12.2 TRANSFER ON OWN REQUEST

be allowed and the bank will bear the cost of only one shipment. Approval from relevant department is 
required prior to shipment of personal effects.   
 
The Administration Department may also assist employees in this matter on the employees’ request.  
 
c) Transportation of Official / Personal vehicle  
Upon permanent transfer of an employee, the Bank would bear the expense of transportation of official 
vehicl e(s) and one personal vehicle by road/rail, whichever mode is cheaper.  
 
d) Expenditures of Transfers  
All Expenses related to the transfer will be borne by the Branch/department to which the employee is being 
transferred.  
  
e)  Accommodation during the settling -down period   
In view of the fact that a recently transferred employee will require some time to find a suitable

Procedures for handling reports can be classified in two categories – informal and formal procedures.  
 
1) INFORMAL PROCEDURE  
Most recipients of harassment simply want the harassment to stop. Informal methods of dealing with the situation 
are often the quicke st and most effective means of achieving this.  
 
In circumstances where it is too difficult or embarrassing for an individual to do this on their own behalf, other 
approaches may be more suitable.  Below are options available for informal handling of a com plaint:  
 
i. Speak directly to the alleged offending party on his /her own or accompanied by a supportive colleague;  
ii. Speak to his/her immediate manager or supervisor, who then speaks to alleged offending party on 
employee’s behalf;  
iii. The employee can ask a colle ague to speak to the alleged offending party on his / her behalf;  
iv. The employee may take no action but keep a written record for future use.  
 
Steps in the informal procedure should be as follows:  
 
i. The alleged offender should be informed that the discussion is informal and confidential;  
ii. The alleged offender should be asked to stop his / her behavior which is the cause of offence;  
iii. The impact of his /her behavior should be explained – that the behavior is unwanted, causes discomfort 
and interferes wi th work;  
iv. The required standard of behavior expected of all employees, as given in the Code of Conduct and this 
procedure, should be conformed;  
v. The likely consequences of continued behavior should be explained;  
vi. The fact that the situation will be monitored should also be explained;  
vii. The alleged offender should be informed that a record is being maintained.  
 
Throughout the informal stage, those employees who feel they are being harassed or discriminated against are advised 
to keep a written record or details t o support any informal request to the alleged offender to stop his /her unwelcome 
behavior.  This documentation is also useful to support any subsequent formal complaint.  
 
Records should include:  
 
i. All incidents  
ii. Date and time  14.1 PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING HARASSMENT CASES

iii. Name of any potential witness  
iv. What effect it had  
v. Any other additional information  
 
2) FORMAL PROCEDURE

ii. The complaint should be lodged in writing including all details of the incident(s) or a statement should be 
recorded in the presence of the Line Manager or the Manager ER at HRD and must be signed by both 
parties.

of harassment or bullying presented to a line manager or to Manager Employee Relations at HRD;  
ii. The investigation will be completed at the earliest possible date preferably within 15 days, wherever possible;  
iii. The Investigation Team will include internal trained investigators and at the Bank’s direction, may include 
an external investigator;  
iv. The Investi gation Team will hold meetings with the complainant, the person(s) against whom the complaint 
has been made and relevant witnesses;  
v. A work colleague may accompany the complainant, the alleged offender and witnesses at meetings with 
Investigation Team;  
vi. The final report of the Investigation Team will be submitted to the Manager Employee Relations – HR; 
vii. A joint decision with regard to appropriate action will be made by the HR and respective Line manager, 
which may include mediation, counseling or further disci plinary action, including termination / dismissal;  
viii. The employee has right of appeal on grounds of unfairness or improper procedures to Disciplinary Action

Where a complainant approache s a manager or supervisor they will be given their respectful attention without 
unnecessary delay.  The role of the manager or supervisor at the informal stage is, however, only one of support or 
assistance.   
 
All reported incidents of harassment will be recorded and in the event of any patterns emerging, management may 
wish to initiate its own formal investigation and take remedial action where this proves to be necessary.  Additionally, 
there may be situations where the seriousness of a complaint warrant s formal procedures being instigated.  
 
In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may initiate an investigation, even where no formal complaint is received, 
where it has serious concerns for the safety, health or welfare of employees.  
 
 
When an employee remains absent from duty for more than three (3) days, without proper authorization, will be issued a 
written notice to resume service within a specific period.

justification to the bank in writing, he/she will be liable for disciplinary action, which may lead to termination of service . The 
said written notice will not be for a perio d of less than three (3) days from the date of dispatch and will be dispatched through 
registered post / courier at the employee’s last recorded address.  
 
If an employee resumes his/her duty and will not be able to provide any acceptable (completely at bank’s own discretion) 
justification for such unauthorized absence, the absence will be treated as “without pay”.  
 
 
The DAC will be authorized to take decisions of any violation of policies & proc edures, act of fraud & forgery, breach of

Meezan Bank is viewed as a center of expertise / repository of knowledge & skills in the field of Islamic Banking. As a resul t 
staff members receive invitations/solicitation to conduct external teaching assignments from time to time.  The objective of 
this guideline is to regulate the manner in which staff may engage in such activity.  
 
• All employees must ensure that their personal interests do not conflict with the duties which are owed to Meezan 
Bank or which Meezan Bank owes to its customers. Similarly the teaching/training engagements should be 
complementary to, and should not interfere with the employee’s duties at the bank.  
• The teaching/trainin g engagements should be managed strictly on the employee’s own time, e.g. after work -hours, 
on weekends, on public holidays, during paid vacations etc.  
• If a teaching assignment requires a staff member to be away from his/her official duties then Annual Lea ve will be 
required to be taken. The normal application/approval procedure for Annual Leave will be followed in this case and 
the maximum number of Annual Leaves for such assignments should NOT be more than 5 days in a calendar year 
unless approved specifi cally by CEO. Casual Leave will not be granted for such engagements. However, teaching / 
training of Islamic Banking -related topics at forums such as SBP, NIBAF & IBP will be exempt from this condition.  
• The maximum compensation/financial benefits gained fr om external teaching / training activities should not be more 
than Rs.100,000/ - per annum. However the President & CEO may grant exceptions to this rule on a case -to-case 
basis.  
• Where the interests of the bank so warrant, the DCEO  and President & CEO may a ssign specific representational 
public -speaking assignments at reputable platforms to specific individuals.  
• The approval of President & CEO is mandatory for planned appearance on any type of media.  
 
i. Any employee  accept ing teaching/training engagements  should  only do so  with prior written approval of CEO on 
the prescribed form  “Approval for Accepting External Teaching” .  
 
ii. A copy of the approved form must be submitted to the Learning & Development  Department prior to the date of 
the engagement.  
 
iii. Such leaves should be incorporated in HRMS if needed.  
 
MBL staff going on public speaking / training assignments should always be conscious that they are representatives of MBL 
and should not make comments / statements that undermine the ideology and platform represented by MBL.

MBL offers House Financing for  its staff to own a residential property. The following Guideline & Procedure are to be 
read in conjunction with the policy on the same.  
 
 
Total outstanding House Finance should be adjusted within 20 Years from the date of disbursement or before the age of 
retirement whichever is earlier. Regular instal ments shall be recovered from the monthly salary of the staff. In case of 
enhancement / change of security, the tenure will be counted from the date of last disbursement under any mode of staff 
housing finance.  
 
In cases where the number of remaining months of service up to staff’s retirement age of 60 fall short of the maximum 
payment period (240 months), the amount of the monthly instalment will be increased to ensure complete recovery of the 
outstanding amount up to retirement. This will be subject to the pri nciple of maximum deduction level of 40% of gross 
salary. The eCIB report of the employee will also be considered before approving this facility.  
 
If the above -mentioned conditions cannot be fulfilled, or if it is observed that the staff will not be able t o repay the 
outstanding amount upon retirement, the Bank shall have the discretion to reduce the amount sanctioned to the concerned 
staff member.  
 
 
The combined facility ceiling for Housing Finance as well as any other faci lity availed by the employee from MBL or any 
other financial institution will be such that the monthly deductions of all payments (wherein the payment of Housing 
Facility will be benchmarked at the first payment of rent plus monthly unit purchase) should n ot exceed 50% of employees’ 
monthly gross salary payable through monthly payroll.  
 
The outstanding liabilities of employees with other financial institutions will also be taken into account while calculating 
DBR. It should be noted as a point of clarificat ion that the rental payment that will start one month after purchase of land 
will not be used as benchmark for calculation of DBR. The DBR will be benchmarked against the first payment of rent 
plus monthly unit purchase. The employee at his / her discretio n may decide to opt for Equal Monthly Installments (EMI) 
or Unequa l Monthly Instal lments  (UMI) and the DBR calculation of the employee will be based on such selection.   
 
 
The following documents will be required:  
 
i. Duly completed prescribed application form;  
ii. Photo copies of title deeds;  
iii. Copy of agreement of sale, if executed;  
iv. Valuation report or estimate as per bank’s standard procedure;  
v. Non-encumbrance certificate or other such certificate issued by a competent authority;  
vi. Copy of the approved plan, if any;  
vii. Copy of an NOC for issuance of sub -lease, where applicable; and  
viii. Any other document  if required by the Bank.  
 
 
The facilities under this scheme will be booked through the Diminishi ng Musharika instrument or any other instrument as 
approved by Meezan Bank ’s Shariah Advisor.  
 
 
House finances allowed to the employees will invariably be secured by equitable mortgage of the said property in favour 
of the Bank, apart from signing required documents. This will however not preclude the Bank from advising the staff to 
execute registere d mortgage at his / her cost and expense, whenever the Bank so decides.

of) the finance. Where the Bank is not so satisfied, it will be free to exercise such rights and options, as it may consider 
expedient, including refusal to grant the finance or recall thereof where the finance has been disbursed in part or whole.  
 
 
An application received for sanctioning of Housing Finance will only be considered where the need for such facility is 
amply justified. It is therefore imperative that the concerned unit should only recommend the application where there is 
genuine need for  such facility.

cancelled, unless renewed or extended by the sanctioning authority. The staff housing finance will be available  only for the 
purchase of one property. The Staff Housing Finance will be available only  in the city /area that are covered under the

Finance facility as per the parameters of this policy may be utilized for any of the following purposes subject to the 
condition that the title of the property should be in the name of employee or spouse:  
 
1) Purchase of a constructed house/flat  
Finance wil l be disbursed as per eligibility criteria mentioned above, subject to entitlement amount, or 90% of 
cost of property, whichever is lower. In case of a difference in the quoted cost and assessed value, the lower of 
the two will prevail for the purpose of d isbursement of the facility. Payment of finance would be started from 
the month following the disbursement of finance.  
 
  
2) Construction of a house on a plot of land owned by the employee  
An employee being the owner of a plot of land is entitled for 100% of  entitlement or 99 % of the cost / value of 
plot, whichever is lower. In case of a difference in the quoted cost and assessed value, the lower of the two will 
prevail for the purpose of disbursement of the facility.  
 
3) Purchase of a residential plot of land  and construction of a house thereon  
For purchase of plot of land, Bank Finance under this scheme will be restricted to 80% of the entitlement  for

a) Maximum 80 percent of the entitlement for purchase of plot.  
b) Maximum up to  20 percent of the entitlement for construction of the same plot.  
 
Guidelines for staff house financing in constructi on cases as defined in clause 23 .8 (2 & 3) above  
 
a) In case of c lause 23 .8 (3) above remaining finance amount would be released during the construction 
period. The periodic disbursement will be made on the request of employee supported by BOQ/running 
bills of architect/contractor:  
 
b) It will be ensured by the employee that constructi on work is started within twelve months and completed 
within a further twelve months period from the date of purchase of plot. It is pertinent to note that 
all/any drawdown from bank should be completed within this period (i.e. within 24 months from the 
date of first drawdown).  
 
c) If construction is not commenced within the stipulated 12 months period or completed in 24 months 
from the date of first drawdown, the profit rate applicable on the financing amount will be charged at 
the rate prevailing for commer cial housing finance by Meezan Bank Limited Easy Home or specific 
Management and PDSC approval will be required for extension in construction period.  
 
d) Payment of finance through Unit purchase would be started one year after the date of disbursement of 
last trenches for construction. However, payment of rent under the product of Diminishing Musharikah 
as being used by the Housing Finance Department will start one month after purchase of land.  
 
For sake of clarification, it should be noted that the Debt Bur den Ratio as defined in section 23 .2 will 
be calculated on the basis of first rent payment plus monthly unit purchase.  
 
The structure of the builder product in this case is such that maximum financing amount under the 
facility can only be up to 99 % of the value of land. Hence, the maximum drawdown for construction 
will be limited to differential between the cost of land and initial disbursement for purchase of land. 
However, if the value of the subject land is less than the construction value, subject t o the availability 
of cushion in entitlement, BOQ verification & availability of Shariah compliant solution additional 
disbursement may be considered af ter specific approval from PDSC.  
 
4) Conversion of pre-existing  commercial mortgage finance  
Finance will be disbursed to the extent of the 80% of assessed value of property. The employee will be responsible 
for arranging the differential from own resources. In order to avoid over -financing, valuation of property will  be 
carried out through the CAD Department of Meezan Bank.  
 
In case of a difference in the balance payable and assessed value, the lower of the two will prevail for the purpose 
of disbursement of the facility. The bank ’s disbursement will be affected only  if the complete funds required for 
repaying the facility can be arranged. Product structure as approved for Easy Replacement will apply.  
 
 
Standard Musharakah documentation for Housing Finance will comprise of the following:

However the Bank may require such additional documents, estimate certificates and proof, as it may deem necessary at 
different stages of disbursement. The Credit Administration Department and the in -house leg al advisor of the Bank shall 
ensure that all documentation is properly completed. Expert opinion with regard to engineering, architecture or valuation 
aspects may also be obtained, if considered necessary. Cost of any such opinion will be on account of the  respective 
employee. Whenever the bank commence Takaful  coverage on housing finance extended to employees, the employee will 
be liable to share Takaful  charges as determined at that time.  
 
 
The disbursement of finance will be subject to production of the relevant documents establishing the free and 
unencumbered title/ownership of the plot of land or the house to the satisfaction of the Bank. Disbursement of the finance 
may be made in lump sum  or in trenches depending upon the requirements of individual cases. Treatment of taxes will be 
as per the Easy Home policy. Disbursement of the facility will fall under two categories:  
 
Drawdown:  Disbursement for acquisition / construction of property  
Takeover:  Acquisition of Housing Finance liability of a person joining Meezan Bank, from previous employer  
 
 
Enhancement in facility amount will be allowed if the entitlement of an employee increases by virtue of promotion, subject 
to the conditions listed below and clearance from PDSC Department on case -to-case basis.  
 
1) Process  
The process of drawdown of enhanced limit is that the previous facility will have to be fully paid -off (except in 
case of renovation / construction on existing property) and a new disbursement will be affected under the terms 
and conditions of the Housing Finance policy applicable a t the time of the fresh  disbursement as detailed below.  
 
2) Conditions  
Enhancement will be allowed on the following lines:  
 
a) Enhancement will be allowed only once in service life with Meezan Bank.  
b) The enhanced amount that an employee may avail will be calcula ted as the difference between the new limit 
and outstanding amount. In case of “Zero” outstanding the full limit may be allowed.  
c) Drawdown on enhanced entitlement will be allowed for renovation / construction on the existing property 
subject to the conditio ns and only if the value of property as assessed through the relevant department of 
MBL is sufficient to provide the requisite margin to the bank. The process of monitoring of utilization of 
funds will be carried out through the relevant department.  
i. For sa ke of clarification, it is emphasized that such drawdown will only be allowed for the purpose of 
actual renovation / construction on the existing property and not for generating liquidity by utilizing 
the enhanced market value of the property.  
ii. It may plea se be noted that enhancement will be available only for:  
a. Purchase of new property, OR  
b. For renovation / construction on existing property  
d) In case of a Takeover for a new incumbent, the takeover disbursement will be counted as the last drawdown, 
after wh ich the employee will be entitled to one enhancement after three years of conti nuous service with 
Meezan Bank.  
e) For employees availing Housing Finance facility for the first time in their service with Meezan Bank (non -
takeover cases) after 30th September 20 06, the minimum time differential between initial Drawdown and 
Enhancement will be eight years.  
f) Cases of staff who wish to avail their enhanced entitlement for construction / renovation of existing property 
or for paying off their existing house finance facilities or the cases of takeover from previous employer will 
be evaluated on a case -to-case basis due to certain Shariah restrictions in extending such financing.  
g) In case of enhancement, the same may be allowed for another 20 years subject to av ailability of room till the 
age of superannuation.  
 
 
The employee shall not, except with the written permission of the bank, sell, mortgage, gift, exchange or otherwise transfer 
or encumber the land, buildings, other constructions until he has repaid in full the principal sum of the finance together 
with other dues, if any. The employee shall also not rent out the property without approval of Head of HR.  
 
The transaction is not allowed for the certain blood relations (i.e. parents, children) and spouse without the approval by 
the competent authority.  23.10  DISBURSEMENT

Treatment of all taxes will be as per the Easy Home Policy.  
 
 
In the event of separation from se rvice for any reason, the entire amount of finance will become payable immediately. If 
not paid by the employee before release / last working  day, the staff house finance will be transferred to MBL commercial 
house financing under product of Easy Home.  
 
The Bank may also have the right to deduct the outstanding finance amount solely at its own discretion from any monies 
that are payable to the employee on account of terminal benefits, salary, provident fund, gratuity etc.  
 
The balance amount in that case  would have to be settled by the employee within two months. Incase of failure, the case 
will be forwarded to Remedial Asset Management Department (RAMD).  
 
 
One needs to be cognizant of the fact that the b ank is responsible to employ shareholders ’ and depositors ’ funds profitably 
and the funds invested in concessional schemes affect this objective; it is therefore requisite that a cap should be imposed 
on the maximum percentage of the bank ’s asset portfolio  to be invested at concessional rates.  
 
All applications received by the management for Concessional Housing Finance beyond the above limit will be dealt at the 
discretion of the management on a case -to case basis. This applies to all employees, i.e. new entrants, lateral entrants and 
current employees.  However if the total outstanding housing finance exceeds the above mentioned cap due to subsequent 
change in the net financing portfolio; the same may no t be considered as the policy violation.  
 
 
All transactions of staff housing finance should conform to Islamic Shariah and as such should be cleared by the PDSC 
Department.  
 
More specifically, if a transaction has already been done under the Diminishing Musharikah mode through Easy Home 
and the employee wants to replace the Easy Home financing by Staff Housing Finance, modalities of the replacement 
transaction will have to be cleared by the PDSC Department.  
 
 
The minimum drawdown amount of housing finance would be Rs.500,000/ -. 
 
 
The changes incorporated in “Staff House Finance P olicy” such as revised limits, revised profit rates etc. will be applicable 
only to the disbursements taking place under the ambit of the revised policy.  
 
Housing Loans / Financing disbursed under the previous policies would continue under the conditions applic able at the 
time of their sanction and will not be affected by the revised terms of the policy.  
 
The staff desirous of availing their enhanced entitlement (if applicable) will avail the new facility under the terms of the 
revised policy.  
 
 
The Human Resources Department shall manage this scheme and the Head of HR will approve staff housing finance 
cases. All applications for financings should be routed through the employee ’s Line Manager and forwarded with his /her 
comments to  the Human Resource Department  for evaluation and approval.  
 
 
Meezan Bank may takeover the outstanding Housing Finance of a new joiner given that an understanding is developed at 
the time of hiring to takeover the liability and approved by the DCEO  and President & CEO.

It is the aspiration of the bank to gradually move towards individual objective setting in a phased manner. Meezan Bank 
Limited’s performance appraisal system is improved and upgraded from time -to-time in -line with the Bank’s requirements, as 
well as with industry practices. Performance Asse ssment should be more than a past -oriented activity that criticizes or praises 
employees for their performance in the preceding year. Rather, appraisal must take a future -oriented view of what employees 
can do to achieve their potential in the bank. This m eans that managers / appraisers must provide the employees with the 
feedback and coach them to achieve higher levels of performance.  
 
 
1) OBJECTIVES OF PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL  
a. Improving the performance of the Bank and its staff members;  
b. Laying a solid foundation for relationships between staff and management;  
c. Clarifying performance targets for all;  
d. Using the process for career planning and professional development of staff;  
e. Review of salary, assignment and career path;  
f. Award of bonuses; and  
g. Promotion to higher salary category and functional responsibilities.  
  
2) ROLE OF IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR AND BRANCH MANAGER / UNIT HEAD 
Performance appraisal is an interactive exchange between the immediate supervisor and staff member(s) reporting to 
him/her. (A supervisor is defined as the person to whom one or more employees report on a regular basis).  
 
The Branch Managers and Department Heads will bear the ultimate responsibility for successful completion of the 
exercise.  
 
3) PROCESS FLOW 
Human Res ource Department will forward the Appraisal Form and guidelines on the appraisal process to all Branches 
/ Departments for the annual appraisal exercise.  
 
4) PROMOTION TO HIGHER GRADES  
Meezan Bank will promote certain number of people to recognize their profe ssional achievements and provide them 
career progression in -line with their performance. Decision in this regard will be taken in consultation with respective 
Manager, Regional Manager and Department Head.  
 
Requirements are received from operating units fo r staff of higher seniority to suit their operational needs. Branches 
and other units of the Bank are to support their promotion recommendations with reference to the ‘organogram’ of 
their unit, explaining precisely the operational requirements that justif y the need of staff with higher seniority.  
 
5) PERFORMANCE OF BRANCH / UNIT  
When competing for promotions to higher grades, overall performance of a Branch, Region or Department will also be a factor 
in considering promotion recommendations. Similarly, audit rating of a branch will also be considered before taking promotion 
decisions.  
 
 
i. The “Appraisal Cost Proposal” and “Appraisal Guidelines” are approved by CEO & DCEO . Net increases in 
payroll and bonus pool are  approved by  Board of  Human Resource & Remuneration Committee.
